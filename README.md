# What

An exercise in opal starting as a port of [http://github.com/jhogendorn/Game-of-Life-in-CoffeeScript.git](http://github.com/jhogendorn/Game-of-Life-in-CoffeeScript.git)

This is a work in progress, I will probably make it more Ruby like
over time

# How to run

    git clone git@github.com:fkchang/game_of_life_opal.git
    bundle install
    rake            # build the necessary files
    open index.html # only tested in safari and chrome on osx
